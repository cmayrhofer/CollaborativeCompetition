## The Learning Algorithm



### Learning Curve


![Learning Curve](learning_curve.png)
In this graphic we see the learning performance of our algorithm. We note that a mean score of 0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes) is reached around 3500 episodes. We continued with training till 10000 episodes though the maximum performance of 1.37 appeared around 5500 episodes.
